                    <p>I've never taken a game class nor have I been serious in the games I do play. I play games for lesiure and to connect with friends. This semester I'm taking a Serious Games course where I am required to
                      blog about the serious games I play. For starters, I just want to say that I watched <a href="https://janemcgonigal.com/">Jane McGonigal's</a> <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/jane_mcgonigal_gaming_can_make_a_better_world/transcript?language=en"> TedTalk </a> on how gaming can make a better world.
                      I loved this talk because for so many years I tried to not game. I intentially tried to not become the gamer I'm meant to be because I was afraid it would take away too much 'real' time out of my day. In addition, my parents discouraged gaming 
                      because my brother was a gamer. My brother spent all his time playing <a href="https://play.na.leagueoflegends.com/en_US">League of Legends.</a> I was afraid of what my parents would think of me. I pushed it away. My brother ended up resenting his time online because of my parents
                      and he didn't know how to find other ways to bring his online success into real life.
                    </p>
                    <p>So,  McGongial's talk really hit a nerve with me because I was a victim of game shame. What McGongial highlighted four characteristics that gamers have. First, there is <b>urgent optimism.</b> Urgent optimism is the desire to act immediately to tackle an obstacle, combined with the belief that we have a reasonable hope of success.
                    Second is creating a <b>tight social fabric.</b> McGongial researched that we like people better after we play a game with them, even if they've beaten us badly because it takes a lot of trust to play a game with someone. Then, there is <b>blissful productivity.</b> Have you ever heard the phrase, "if you pick a job you love, you'll never work a day in your life?"
                    Simiarly, People are happier working hard than we are relaxing, or hanging out- when we love what we do. Gamers are willing to work hard all the time, if they're given the right work. Finally: <b>epic meaning.</b> Gamers love to be attached to awe-inspiring missions. Simiarly, people love being part of a project or company
                    that is bigger than themselves. Well, at least I know I do.  </p>
                    <p>
                      So, I decided to play a game similar to McGongial's <a href="https://www.superbetter.com/">Superbetter</a> game that I found on <a href="https://itch.io/">Itch.io</a> called <a href="https://the-quinnspiracy.itch.io/depressionquest">Depression Quest.</a> The summary is as follows from the website:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <i>Depression Quest is an interactive fiction game where you play as someone living with depression. You are given a series of everyday life events and have to attempt to manage your illness, relationships, job, and possible treatment. This game aims to show other sufferers of depression that they are not alone in their feelings, and to illustrate to people who may not understand the illness the depths of what it can do to people.</i>

                    <p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

                    <p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>
