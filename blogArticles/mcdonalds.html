                  <h2 class="section-heading">What is a Serious Game?</h2>
                    <p> What is a serious game? Initally when I registered for this class, I thought of the games on <a href="https://www.coolmath4kids.com/"> Cool Math 4 Kids.</a> I feel like I'm not too far from the definition either.
                      The best defintion I found was by David Kelly in his book, <a href ="https://www.amazon.com/Art-Reasoning-Third-David-Kelley/dp/0393972135"> Art of Reasoning.</a>
                      Kelley stated that a game is a form of recreation constituted by a set of rules that specify an object to be attained and the permissible means of attaining it. (Kelley, 1988) While I believe this defintion is true for games in general, we have only scratched the surface
                      for serious games. I want to add more content to the defintion of a game. This defintion is good but I believe games are more than rules that allow you suceed. Games also have consequences. If you are playing <a href ="https://www.callofduty.com/" >"Call of Duty"</a> 
                      and get shot, you lose stamina, strength, and your player is weak. To a certain extent, you even die and have to restart. So, when <a href="https://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/1065701">Clark C Abt</a> considers serious games effective for teaching and training tools because they offer ‘‘a rich field for a risk-free, 
                      active exploration of serious intellectual and social problems,’’ Abt is implying that there is a disconnection between the real world and the virtual world. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      I believe there is no disconnection betweena video games and the real world because the skills you learn in a video game can be easily applied to the real world. 
                      Daphne Bavelier, a cognitive researcher, presented a <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/daphne_bavelier_your_brain_on_video_games?utm_campaign=tedspread&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=tedcomshare">TedTalk</a> about the positive effects of video games.
                      One point Bavelier made was that video games provide the advantage of increased attention. The attention Bavelier studied was ability to track objects around in the world. In her studies, she found that people who played more video games has increased 
                      ability to track multiple items (4 items or above) better than those who do not play video games. In addition, Bavelier made a point during her talk that video games are not good when you play excessively or binging. Video games are best in moderation
                      just like wine. If we play video games, we could imporve our attnetion, improve our eyesight (mentioned in the video), and increase our eduction through games we really enjoy. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      As noted by Michael and Chen (2006), serious games are also becoming ever more important in the global education and training market, which in 2003 was estimated at $2 trillion. It is also predicted that “by 2008, 40 percent of U.S. companies will adopt serious games in their training efforts” (ibid., p.xvi).
                      In a world ready to adopt serious games that could change our lives and improve our brain, there is an accepted defintion for serious games. Serious games are games used for purposes other than mere entertainment. Serious games are meant for education or for practice. For instance, remember when I mentioned 
                      Cool Math 4 Kids? Well those games were fun and educational. I shot at rockets while also learning my multiplication table. 
                      So now that we have an understanding what a game and a serious game is. Here is my defintion. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <i>A serious game is a game meant for education or for practice that imitates real-world scenarios in a entertaining, rule-based fashion while creating a rich field for a risk and
                        active exploration of serious intellectual and social problems. </i>
                    </p>
                    
        
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Applying the Defintion to the Game</h2>
                    <p>
                      I played <a href="https://www.molleindustria.org/mcdonalds/">The McDonalds Videogame.</a> The McDonalds videogame meets my definition because it is meant for education. The game's purpose is to teach its players about all aspects of the McDonalds indsutry from 
                      farming, slaughtering, in-store interaction, and corporate McDonalds. It gives you details on how you add GMO's to your crops so they grow more, add hormones to cows so they can grow, and even plan PR strategies to win over more customers. A fun feature I found is
                      that if you cut down trees to make room for more farming land, the game simulates protesters that bring down the stock value of McDonalds. Overall, it really simulates what it takes to run a McDonalds. The formal game biography is here:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <i>"Making money in a corporation like McDonald's is not easy! Behind every burger there is a complex process you need to master: from pastures to the slaughterhouse, from restaurants to branding. You'll discover all the dirty secrets that made us one of the biggest company in the world."</i>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      So, the Mcdonalds videogame fit my defintion because it is meant for education as explained above. It iminitates real world scenarios, such as cultivating food, slaughtering cows (the cows can get sick, then you have to kill them) and real PR stunts that we see today. 
                      There are rules to the game, there is only so much land I can take for crops or cows. In addition, I have to wait for the crops to cultivate and I have to wati for the cows to be ready for slaughter. These factors make the game hard to play. 
                      The game invites active exploration of serious social problems. For example, I mentioned that protesters will complain about removing trees to make land for crop production. This is a serious social problem we face today. Do we want more corporations to cut down forests for their
                      own capitol gain? In addition, I mentioned hormones for the cows and using GMOs for our crops. In our world, these are real problems we discuss. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      We know the McDonalds videogame fits my defintion but does it have all the qualities of a game? Here is a list of things it needs:
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          Purpose or raison d’eˆ tre;
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Procedures for action;
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Rules governing action;
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Number of required players;
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Roles of participant;
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Participant interaction patterns
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Results or pay-off
                        </li>
                      </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The McDonalds game has the purpose of being a successful business where it makes profit, pleases it customers, and makes good eco-friendly decisions. The procedures of actions are farming, slaughtering, selling, and working on the corporate side of the company.
                      There are rules governing action defined above from how many burgers are possible to sell, to how long cultivating the fields take, to how much money you are allowed to spend on new campaigning strategies. 
                      There is one player but there are many implied players that help you along the way. The implied player is also a design aid for game designers, as it helps them picture the people who will be playing their creations (cf. Smith, 2006, pp. 23–24). In this case, the 
                      store manager who screams when they need more employees or the business executives who complain about revenue are designed to help you throughout the game. To corroborate with my last statement, the role of the players are defined by the spaces they occupy. The store manager is in the store, the business
                      executive is in the business, and your role as the player of game is to manage all aspects. You are super manager. There are participation interaction patterns, when you plant and produce enough plants for the cows, the man in the slaughter house is happy. Similar to when you can produce
                      enough meat for the store, the store manager is happy. The results are to try and successfully run a business using all the tools they taught you. It is a game of profitability and entrepreneurship.
                    </p>
                    <p> I remember playing this game as a child and I did pretty well back then. Now? Not so much.</p>
