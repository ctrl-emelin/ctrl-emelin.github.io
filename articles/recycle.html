          <br>
          <p>
            <b>What is the goal of the Recycle Roundup? Is it clear? Is it compelling to me? Why or why not?</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            The goal of <a
              href="https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/games/action-and-adventure/recycle-roundup-new/">Recycle
              Roundup</a> is to put the flying trash in the correct bin in under 2 minutes. The directions are clear to
            me because it is the opening line before you start to play. In addition,
            the elements of the game is clear. Your character is at the center of 3 bins. One is for recycling, one is
            for compost, and the center is for trash. The objective of the game is compelling to me.
            It is only compelling because I want to recycle more and I want to encourage eeveryone to recycle as well.
            It is a message that comes with little to no guidance. <i>How do you recycle?</i> is a
            question I get often. This game does a simple job at telling you how to recycle. At the end of the game, it
            even tells you how many items you got wrong and how many items you got right. There is
            feeedback and opportunity to grow in the game. I guess what I am trying to say is that it is compelling to
            me because I am passionate about recycling.

          <p>
            <b>What’s the game’s core dynamic? Is it exploration, collection, “race to the finish,” solve—or a blend of
              two different dynamics such as collection AND race to the finish?</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            The game's core dynamic is collection and "race to the finish." It is a blend of these two concepts because
            the character you are playing is collecting information about the different types of
            trash there is as it falls from the ground. If you do not know how to recycle, you would need to consult
            another source to tell you how to recycle and how to identify the items. In a way, this game
            encourages players to look at outside resources to figure out how to recycle (if you don't know already).
            The "race to the finish" is encouraged by the time limit. You want to recycle as many things
            as you can in under 2 minutes. If you were to play with others, this game could be a competition among many
            friends. Who knows how to recycle the best?
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>Are the rules clear? How do I learn them?</b>
          </p>

          <p>
            The rules are clear, as shown above in the first image. The rules are displayed before you play the game.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>What game mechanics (aka rules) make the game most fun? Which one(s) would I change? What would happen if
              I did?</b>
          </p>

          <p>
            The game mechanics that make the game most fun is the time limit. If there were no time limit, the game
            would be meaningless and it wouldn't be fun. One thing I would change about the game is adding
            an element where if you put the trash in the wrong bin, or attempted to, the game wouldn't allow it. A
            warning sign like, <i>this is the wrong bin!</i> would make the game better. It would be make the
            game better because the player would be quickly notified of their mistake and will be able to learn from the
            mistake instead of waiting for the end. Below shows an image of my game play and what
            elements I got wrong, but it does not provide further guidance on how I can fix this or what I got wrong.

            class="caption text-muted">Screenshot of My Score and Results</span>

          <p>
            <b>Do the aesthetics of the game draw me in? What emotional reaction do the aesthetics elicit in me?</b>
          </p>

          <p>
            The aesthetics of the game draw me in because there are very warm colors. I know this game is inviting me to
            positively learn about recyclying. The color green is the color of balance,
            harmony and growth. At least according to this nice <a
              href="https://www.empower-yourself-with-color-psychology.com/color-green.html">website.</a> Since I found
            this on a <a href=" https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/games/">children's website</a>
            I can see how the color scheme of the game can invite children to play this game. The monster in the middle
            also seems very friendly. I would be his friend.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>Is the game “balanced” in the sense that it accommodates different player levels? How?</b>
          </p>

          <p>
            Recycle Roundup is not "balanced" in the sense that it accomodates different player levels because it
            doesn't offer that. It is a one-stop game with an optional element of competition among friends. No
            levels are offered or encouraged.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>What’s the balance between strategy and chance? Do I feel like I have control over the outcome by the
              choices I make in the game or do I feel the outcome is almost all chance?</b>
          </p>

          <p>
            Players have control over the outcome by the choices they make in the game because it is all about your
            knowledge on recycling. If a player has no idea how to recycle, this game isn't going to teach you. It
            may create an environment for a player to look outside the game as resources on how to recycle and what to
            recycle but the game itself does not provide that. So, this game is really about strategy and less about
            chance.
            It is about how you will look up things to recycle within the 2 minute time limit and get all the items
            recycled without putting it in a different bin. The player is 100% responsible and in control the choices
            they mistake
            in the game. Thus, it affects how the game is played and successful.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>Is the game cooperative, competitive, or a blend of both?</b>
          </p>

          <p>
            The game could be competitive. As mentioned, there is a time-limit and if played with friends, it could be a
            compeititon.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>If the game is competitive and I lose, how does this make me feel? Does it motivate me to play again or
              do I want to avoid playing again so I can avoid losing?
            </b>
          </p>

          <p>
            There is no losing in the game. This question is a bit subjective to the player. A player could
            theoretically lose if they do not collect any points or miss every chance to recycle. Subjectively, a player
            could lose because
            they didn't succeed in collecting as much trash as they wanted in the time limit or they put too many items
            in the wrong bin that they didn't expect or their friends had a much better score than they did. I believe
            this game
            leaves players to their own imagination on how it should be played competitively.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>If it’s a digital game, how easy is it to navigate? Can I quickly learn by exploring?</b>
          </p>

          <p>
            This is a digital game that is easy to navigate because it prompts instructions as soon as you launch the
            play button. In addition, the character is moved by your mouse or trackpad. Players would easily see that
            their mouse/trackpad
            movements influence the way the character moves around the screen. Finally, the last step is collecting the
            trash which is a little intutitve. All you have to do is the click your track/pad or mouse. It picks up the
            trash and you can
            click again to dump the trash in the right or wrong bin.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Finally, as a learning game designer, what elements from this game could I use in a game I design?</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            I believe I can use the theme and objective of this game for a game I design. I am passionate about
            recycling as a I mentioned before, so using the theme of this game of recycling could be a simple step for
            me. In addition, the objective
            of knowing how to recycle and when to recycle is something I could improve on and use for a game I design.
