      <h3>Experience</h3>
      <p>
        I am currently a senior privacy red team engineer at TikTok.
      </p>

      <p>
        I worked as a privacy engineer at Google

      </p>

      <p>
        I worked as cybersecurity engineer at <a href="https://www.geico.com/ ">Geico</a> helping to improve
        a newly implemented identity and access tool.

      </p>


      <p> I interned at
        <a href="https://dash.nichd.nih.gov/">The National Insitutes of Health</a>
        as a Privacy & Product Management Fellow. I was able to accomplish this with the help of the <a
          href="https://www.codingitforward.com/civic-digital-fellowship">Civic Digital Fellowship</a>.
        I developed a detailed policy brief on data sharing consent using the Honest Broker federated analytics, a new
        implementation for NIH agencies, and provided a technological breakdown of how the Honest Broker works for key
        stakeholders to understand
        I also proposed and drafted a technical document highlighting improvements for the DASH research data repository
        that includes metadata organization, privacy benchmark metrics, and guidelines for researchers to contribute
        data efficiently.

      </p>

      <p> I interned at
        <a href="https://about.google/?fg=1&utm_source=google-US&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=hp-header">Google</a>
        as a Privacy Engineer Intern investigating privacy impacting scenarios between guest mode users, child users,
        adult users, and incognito mode users
        using the same device. I found 3 conversation starters about consistent privacy across similar products. I
        contributed to the launch of the first privacy engineering
        training for Google.org and partner organizations to help improve the process of anonymization of personally
        identifiable information in public datasets.

      </p>

      <p> I interned at
        <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/index.html">Cisco</a>
        as a Security Solutions Intern developing consulting techniques to advise businesses
        on improving security controls.
      </p> I interned at
      <a href="https://risc.rutgers.edu/ccis">Rutgers Institute For Secure Communities</a>
      as a IC CAE Intern contributing analysis for <a href="https://ccicada.org/about-ccicada/">CCICADA </a>
      AI tool better understand
      policy implementation and protect U.S citizens.
      </p>
      <p>
        I interned at <a href="https://www.njtc.org/">NJ Tech Council</a> as a Data Analyst intern providing
        insights on
        how effective empowering women in NJ can lead to diversifying the workplace
      </p>

      <h3>Research</h3>
      <p>I researched election security with <a href="http://www.rdnj.org/">New Jersey Research &
          Development Council</a> as part
        of the <a href="https://www.govstemscholars.com/">Governor's STEM Scholar</a> program. I lead 5 high school
        students in research and implementation
        of a an election machine prototype.
