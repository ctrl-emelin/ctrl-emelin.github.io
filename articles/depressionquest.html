      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-10 col-lg-8 mx-auto">
          <p>I've never taken a game class, nor have I been serious in the games I do play. I play games for leisure and
            to connect with friends. This semester I'm taking a Serious Games course where I am required to
            blog about the serious games I play. For starters, I just want to say that I watched <a
              href="https://janemcgonigal.com/">Jane McGonigal's</a> <a
              href="https://www.ted.com/talks/jane_mcgonigal_gaming_can_make_a_better_world/transcript?language=en">
              TedTalk </a> on how gaming can make a better world.
            I loved this talk because, for so many years, I tried not to game. I intentionally tried not to become the
            gamer I'm meant to be because I was afraid it would take away too much 'real' time out of my day. In
            addition, my parents discouraged gaming because my brother was a gamer. My brother spent all his time
            playing <a href="https://play.na.leagueoflegends.com/en_US">League of Legends.</a> I was afraid of what my
            parents would think of me. I pushed it away. My brother ended up resenting his time online because of my
            parents
            , and he didn't know how to find other ways to bring his online success into real life.
          </p>
          <p>So, McGonigal's talk really hit a nerve with me because I was a victim of game shame. McGonigal highlighted
            four characteristics that gamers have. First, there is <b>urgent optimism.</b> Urgent optimism is the desire
            to act immediately to tackle an obstacle, combined with the belief that we have a reasonable hope of
            success.
            Second is creating a <b>tight social fabric.</b> McGonigal researched that we like people better after we
            play a game with them, even if they've beaten us badly because it takes a lot of trust to play a game with
            someone. Then, there is <b>blissful productivity.</b> Have you ever heard the phrase, "if you pick a job you
            love, you'll never work a day in your life?"
            Similarly, People are happier working hard than we are relaxing or hanging out- when we love what we do.
            Gamers are willing to work hard all the time if they're given the right work. Finally: <b>epic meaning.</b>
            Gamers love to be attached to awe-inspiring missions. Similarly, people love being part of a project or
            company that is bigger than themselves. Well, at least I know I do. </p>
          <p>
            So, I decided to play a game similar to McGonigal's <a href="https://www.superbetter.com/">Superbetter</a>
            game that I found on <a href="https://itch.io/">Itch.io</a> called <a
              href="https://the-quinnspiracy.itch.io/depressionquest">Depression Quest.</a> The summary is as follows
            from the website:
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Depression Quest is an interactive fiction game where you play as someone living with depression. You are
              given a series of everyday life events and have to attempt to manage your illness, relationships, job, and
              possible treatment. This game aims to show other sufferers of depression that they are not alone in their
              feelings, and to illustrate to people who may not understand the illness the depths of what it can do to
              people.</i>
          </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">My Review of Depression Quest</h2>
          <p>I felt connected to Depression Quest. Although I am not formally or 'officially' diagnosed with Depression,
            I almost cried playing this game. This wasn't an enjoyable game, and I felt like it dragged on. I didn't
            think I was going to finish it, but I'm glad I did.
            The game consisted of scenarios - typically long blocks of text - that would describe what was happening to
            the character, how they felt, what was going through their mind, their ambitions, inabilities, and promoted
            the player to chose the next course of action. I found that I chose answers that always nudged the character
            to keep pushing forward. It is a trick I use when I feel low. I always try to push through any obstacle. For
            instance, the character didn't want to attend his girlfriend's party because he was emotionally drained. I
            made sure that the character made it to the party. Similarly, there are times where I feel like I go through
            lows. These lows are not prompted by my environment but by my thoughts. I get low to the point where I don't
            want to do anything. I don't want to be social nor do
            I want to exhaust my social energy. However, I know if I crawl into my bed and ignore things, I will never
            get over it. I had the same mindset for my character. Through every obstacle, whether it was seeking help or
            deciding if going to a therapist was a good idea - I
            pushed through.
          </p>
          <p>I feel like the game gave me a real sense of what someone with diagnosed Depression feels. It also helped
            me see that even the simplest tasks are the hardest. For example, when I wanted to schedule an appointment
            with the therapist for the character, there was pushback.
            I wasn't able to make the phone call immediately. It took my character two more different scenarios before
            he could call to make an appointment. The story pointed out that sometimes the hardest step is the first
            step. It was true for my character and true for myself. I also had a hard time finding a therapist or even
            making an appointment. There was a moment in my life where I stood in front of the building, ready to make
            an appointment, but I walked away without making one. The first step is the hardest.
          </p>
          <p>By the end of the game, I felt accomplished that I was able to get my character to see a therapist,
            strengthen his relationships with friends and family, and start thinking about his life from a new
            perspective. The game made me realize that Depression doesn't have a cure and the game didn't have a happy
            ending. It had a realistic ending. Everyday is a small battle to being better. Now that I finished the game,
            I feel more confident about finding resources for myself or researching ways to help others.
          </p>
          <p>To relate back to McGonigal's four characteristics of gamers. I felt like I had an urgent optimism to act
            immediately to help the character out of Depression, combined with the belief that I have a reasonable hope
            of success. In addition to believing I could help the character,
            I believed I would get an epic ending. That ending was ultimately helping the character and ultimately
            feeling like I can help anyone after the game-even myself. This was a solo game, so I didn't have a chance
            to connect with anyone, but I did suggest the game to some of my friends.
            Maybe if my friends played, they would be able to start more discussion about the game itself and how they
            feel about it. Lastly, while playing the game, I felt happy because I was on the road to helping my
            character become a better person for himself. To my comment about the game being boring, it is boring for
            someone who is not invested. The game is a lot of reading that people may not be ready for, but I felt ready
            for the challenge, and while playing, I felt addicted to finding out how I can help my character more. Am I
            a gamer?
          </p>
          <p>This is my first serious game and I can't wait to play more. </p>
