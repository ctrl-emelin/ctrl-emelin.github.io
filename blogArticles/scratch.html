          <h2 class="section-heading">What is Scratch? </h2>
          <p>
            Before I begin analyzing Scratch. Here is what <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a> is:
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>With Scratch, you can program your own interactive stories, games, and animations — and share your
              creations with others in the online community.
              Scratch helps young people learn to think creatively, reason systematically, and work collaboratively —
              essential skills for life in the 21st century.
              Scratch is a project of the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the MIT Media Lab. It is provided free of
              charge. </i>
          </p>

          <img class="img-fluid" src="../resources/media/pictures/scratch1.png"></a><span
            class="caption text-muted">Screenshot of Interactive Scratch</span>
          <p>
            In short, Scratch is an interactive platform that teaches people how to play by using blocks and animation.
            When I first enrolled into Rutgers,
            one of the first classes I took was Introduction to Computer Concepts. For many students, this was an 'easy
            A' class. It taught us basic computer concepts. For instance,
            it taught us how to use Gmail, Google Drive, and Scratch. In this class, we were introduced to Scratch. I
            remember the professor said, <i> if you are interesting in
              becoming a computer science major, this is not the class for you. This class is for beginners. </i> At the
            time, that was exactly what I was, a beginner.
          </p>
          <p>
            Scratch was amazing to me because I hadn't formally coded before or created animations. I remember tinkering
            in HTML on Tumblr's early days or <a
              href="https://www.techradar.com/how-to/phone-and-communications/mobile-phones/what-is-jailbreaking-1322927">jailbreaking</a>
            my iPhone 3.
            Even when I did these things, I didn't know the weight of programming or what it could really do. When I
            started using Scratch, that is exactly what it taught me. Scratch
            taught me to think like a computer. We often overlook our simple tasks of counting or using a method we
            always use because it comes easy to us but for computers, you have to spell it out. The skill
            of simpflying everyday life for computer language is a skill that is very valuable to me because it taught
            me how to explain things from a different perspective.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before Scratch, I hadn't used any learning platform that resembled it so it was my first time. In class, we
            were handed hands-on resources
            like Scratch cards or manuals on how to put together your first game in Scratch. I wish I had those
            resources when I took Intro to Computer Concepts
            because they would have some in handy. In class this past week, I played <a
              href="https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/297267/">several interactive Scratch games</a>. One game that stood
            out to me was Wave Escape.
          </p>
          <p>
            <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/16240179/">Wave Escape by user NotWadeWilson</a> is an interactive
            game about escaping a tsunami. The objective of the game is to collect
            supplied and family members and escape. I wouldn't consider this game a serious game but there is some
            serious consideration to this game design. It reminded me
            of the first pokeman or Legend of Zelda games. The image below is of the gameplay. I think it was very well
            thought out and put together but I didn't learn anything from the game though. I wish there was more of a
            learning aspect. Something
            I could have learned are what items am I picking up and why? What is the importance of this product? What
            happens if I don't have access to the product, what could I take instead?
            What other alternative ways could I survive if I couldn't run away or didn't have access to a car? All these
            questions were running through my head and are critques or suggestions on how
            the game can improve to be a serious game.
          </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Analyzing Scratch as a Platform</h2>
          <p>
            I am analyzing scratch based off <a href="https://www.raphkoster.com/about-raph/">Raph Koster's</a>, a
            multi-award winning game designer, virtual communities expert, writer and speaker, <a
              href="https://www.raphkoster.com/2014/01/06/how-i-analyze-a-game/">blog entry</a> on how
            he analyzes games. I will list headers to describe the key points he suggests and go in-depth about scratch
            below it.
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                What are the systems?
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    When you open up Scratch, there are blocks that indicate motion, looks, sound, events, controls,
                    senses, operators, variables, and customizable options. However, what does this all mean?
                    All these blocks are asking the user to make a choice. There is a blank screen in the middle, to
                    assemble the blocks and a character in a box with a stop sign and green flag on top to indicate stop
                    and go.
                    <i>What are the systems?</i> They are the mechanics of the game. The blocks, the blank screen, the
                    cat in the white box, "Sprite name, the direction and size. It is the whole screen.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <br>
              <img class="img-fluid" src="../resources/media/pictures/scratch3.png"></a><span
                class="caption text-muted">Screenshot of Scratch Create Page</span>
              <li>
                What are the systems about?
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <i>What is are the mechanics telling the player to do?</i> Similar to legos, the blocks on the left
                    side of the page are asking the user to build. Build something motion, or something that senes,
                    just build. The white screen is inviting the user to use this space. This is your space. The
                    components on the right side of the screen are saying, these are your results. See what you did. The
                    systems are inviting
                    creativity, inspiration, and intutition to build anything.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                How do I touch the system, and how does it touch me?
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <i> What are the inputs I can perform and the feedback I get back?</i> In Scratch you are able to
                    create a game or play a game. The inputs are building blocks, literally, to create a game.
                    Scratch does not give you much direction once you start connecting blocks, there are no right
                    answers. Scratch assumes you've read the documentation or watched the video on how to use the
                    platform
                    in order to use it. It is equally an important lesson to know that programming comes in more than
                    one form so there can't be any wrong answers. The feedback you receive is either your code runs
                    differently than
                    expected or you recieve feedback underneath your published work.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>

                class="caption text-muted">Screenshot of Comments underneath Wave Escape</span>
              <li>
                What is the game experience?
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <i> What is the visual storytelling? What are the graphics rendering? What about music and
                      writing?</i> Scratch, as you are creating a game, doesn't have much. It has a cool looking cat and
                    colorful blocks.
                    For a child, this is very appealing. When you put together a game like Wave Escape, it is very
                    appealing. It looks amazing. It has all the color, the music, the appeal. The visual story telling
                    of Scratch is what you make it. So, Scratch
                    is a game that is up for interpretation.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                What is the experience about?
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <i>What is the intent?</i> When you look at the intent of Scratch, to give users a platform to
                    openly learn how to program by building games - the aesthetics mean nothing.
                    Scratch is just a platform to create, share games, and build a community. The visuals don't have to
                    be pretty but what you create makes Scratch beautiful.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Do these things all match up?
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <i>Do the intents match?</i> In Koster's post, he said the answer is normally no. However, I believe
                    Scratch's intent matches with Scratch itself. If Scratch was meant to be a
                    source code editor for kids - they did that. They really did. Scratch does exactly what they intend
                    to do, they created something with that intent and it flourished into a community.
                    I would say MIT did more than just create a kid-friendly source code editor, they built a community
                    of young programmers.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                What about fun?
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <i> Did I personally enjoy this?</i> If you are using Scratch for a course that isn't pertained to
                    your major, you might not have enjoyed Scratch. If you are
                    interested in computer science, you will enjoy this platform. If you are curious about programming
                    or building games, you will enjoy this. If you wouldn't want to touch a computer ever again, this is
                    not the platform for you.
                    What I am trying to say is that Scratch is for everyone if everyone has an open mind!
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>



          <p>
            Overall, I believe Scratch is a great way to segway into programming if you are just beginning. It may seem
            like a childs game at first but there are fundamental concepts that everyone must learn.
            Onto the next game! :)
