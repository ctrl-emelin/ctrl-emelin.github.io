          <h2 class="section-heading">defining a serious game in context to Gamestar Mechanics </h2>
          <p>
            As a refresher to my last post, I created my own definition for a serious game:
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>A serious game is a game meant for education or for practice that imitates real-world scenarios in a
              entertaining, rule-based fashion while creating a rich field for a risk and
              active exploration of serious intellectual and social problems. </i>
          </p>
          <p>
            My definition still holds out to be strong. However, I want to add more elements to my definition. I
            recently watched a
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahYeJ5LmnXI&feature=youtu.be"></a>Ted talk</a> by Robert Torres
            Ph.D, a former teacher
            and school principal and now a Senior Program Officer at the <a href="https://www.gatesfoundation.org/">Bill
              and Melinda Gates
              Foundation.</a> Torres helps to lead the Gates Foundation digital media and college readiness work. He
            served aa the Chief
            Research Officer at Institute of Play where he co-founded Quest to Learn, a games-based school in New York
            City.
            His research at Quest to Learn and on Gamestar Mechanic, a video game designed to support kids development
            of basic game
            skills, has focused on the potential game design and games-based environments have in supporting cognitive
            development. In his talk,
            Torress explains that 97% of kids play video games and 50% of those kids in ubran areas are dropping out of
            school. This statistic scared
            Torres into research about how he can fix this problem. Torress mentioned two things that stuck to me.
          </p>
          <p>
            First, game mechanics govern our behavior in games. The way we are limited or supplied in games increases a
            sense of relevance because you know what you're doing because you're handed with tools to guide you and
            objectvie to achieve.
            This aspect is important in learning why you do the things you do. It makes learning meaningful, it makes
            games meaningful. This
            concept applied to the infamous line of,<i> "I can't just sit around and listen in lecture, I need to do
              something!"</i> Torres is saying
            that with games, we are able to create meaningful connection to the material we are learning because we have
            a hands-on approach when
            it comes to games.
          </p>
          <p>
            Second, games require players to solve complex problems, sometimes life changing problems like <a
              href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/09/110918144955.htm">discovering the protetin
              structure for AIDS.</a> Games will engage students or any learners to solve problems they wouldn't have
            imagined to solve. It is an invitation
            to fail, succeed, try again, and repeat. On the topic of failing, suceeding, and trying. I read another
            article by
            researchers at the <a href="http://gamelab.mit.edu/tag/education-arcade/">The Education Arcade at the
              Massachusetts
              Institute of Technology (MIT).</a> Researchers
            explain that there
            are 5 freedoms that gamers experience (Klopfer, Osterweil, &Salen, 2009).

          </p>

          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Freedom to Fail
              </li>
              <li>
                Freedom to Experiment
              </li>
              <li>
                Freedom to Fashion Identities
              </li>
              <li>
                Freedom of Effort
              </li>
              <li>
                Freedom of Interpretation
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <p>
            I believe all games have these elements. When you try a new path or method to solve a problem, you are
            inviting failure, effort, and experimentation.
            When you join an Role-Playing game, you are choosing your online identity. When you play a game like Dungens
            and Dragons, you are inviting interpretations
            of how the games should be played or when you are solving a problem you are running through all possible
            interpretations of a problem to get the answer.
          </p>

          <p>
            I want to go back to Torres' statsitic about 50% of students in urban communities that play video games drop
            out of school. Sometimes,
            it may be because traditional school spend too much time in classrooms and listening to lectures.
            Researchers at University of Genoa, in Genoa, Italy
            found that students can only remember 10 percent of what they read, but almost 90 percent, if they engage in
            the job themselves, even if only as a simulation (Bellotti,& Gloria, 2010). However, I also believe that
            education has a very broad spectrum and cannot be guaranteed by single tools. If the tool is just lecturing,
            then a student
            who succeeds in lectures cannot be compared to a student who does not succeed lectures. Serious games can
            provide an alternative
            to that.

          </p>
          <p>
            As mentioned in previous blog, serious games can provide an environment for 21st century skills like
            collaboration, critical thinking skills,
            communication, community, and so much more. Sometimes students learn more in a game than in lecture.
          </p>

          <p>Let's apply these concepts to my frist game review. </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Critical Video Game Review</h2>
          <p>
            I played <a href="https://gamestarmechanic.com/">Gamestar Mechanics.</a> GameStar Mechanic's bio is here:
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>
              " Gamestar Mechanic is a game and community designed to teach kids the principles of game design and
              systems thinking in a highly engaging environment. It is designed for 7- to 14-year-olds but is open to
              everyone.
              We've included features in Gamestar that make it useful for kids playing the game on their own or with
              family
              members at home, as well as in moderated and educational settings."
            </i>
          </p>

          <p>
            In my review I'll be looking at elements provided to me on this <a
              href="https://critical-gaming.blogspot.com/2008/07/how-to-write-critical-video-game-review.html">
              blog</a> by author, KirbyKid.
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Pacing
              </li>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The pacing of the game was to your own pace. There is a story to the game that tries to encourage
                  urgency. For instance, there was a part
                  of the story where the character gets stuck on an elevator and the narrator says that they need to
                  complete these games quickly to get out of the elevator.
                  Although the narration is urgent, the game is not. You can fail the games as much as you like and you
                  will fix the elevator as soon as your done. It is invited users
                  to come to the game. It is not a game that you can finish in one sitting (unless you have time). It is
                  a game meant to be played incrementally.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <li>
                Game Depth & Emergence & Balance
              </li>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The game complexsity speaks to the realm of game design and gets deep into the mechanics. At one point
                  in the game and in the image below,
                  Gamestar explains all the components that make up a good game or what should be considered when
                  creating a game. In fact, all the levels and
                  challeneges you go through in the game focus on one particular aspect. For instance, if you are
                  working on timing, the game will give you the
                  challenege to <i>"fix"</i> a game's timing so that it is playable. The interplay in Gamestar is if you
                  succeed in completing a level, you get closer
                  to beating the storyline (which is catching a criminal game designer). If you lose games, you can keep
                  on trying until you get it. The counterpart
                  of this game is that all mechanics that you learn about how a game should be designed come together
                  when you are designing your own game as challenge.
                  First, you must learn the foundation! Overall, the game depth and emergence is postitive because it
                  invites interpretation,
                  failure, experimentation, and effort.

                  <li>
                    The controls in the game are straight forward and even give you instructions. Sometimes you will
                    have a gun to defeat enemes or simply have
                    the option to jump. The controls of this game are straight forward to increase the efficiency of
                    gameplay.

                <li>
                  The story to this game is told very eloquently, it reminds me of an anime. There is dialogue,
                  narration, and direction in each scene.
                  I never feel lost and completely engaged. There are colors and clues. The text is in comic book format
                  so you know to follow from the left
                  of the screen to the right. It feels like I am reading a book. In addition, there are graphics that
                  highlight urgency or motion in the story that
                  help me stay engaged.

              <ul>
                <li>
                  The gameplay of Gamestar Mechanics is smooth and has a lot of direction in detial. Whenever I have a
                  question, I can find it. If I am
                  stuck, I don't have to worry about restarting the whole game. When I want to read the storyline again,
                  I can always go back. There are even
                  hints to winning levels. I enjoy the beginning objectives provided because it gives me a chance to
                  feel like I know what I am doing. My experience in the game gives me experience. As I mentioned
                  before, the game
                  is incremental so you learn a new skill as you reach a new level to ultimatelt become a game designer.
                  It feels as if you
                  are going through school or building the game yourself to ultimately start publishing your own games
                  on the website. It is a
                  very hands-on experience. Everything you do and learn matters because in the end you can show off your
                  skills by building your own
                  games.
                </li>

              <br>

            </ul>
          </p>

          <p>
            Overall, I feel like 'Gamestar' is an excellent game for the introduction of my Serious Games course. It
            reminded of concepts
            I've mentioned in previous posts and I can see children learning a lot. Until then...onto the next game!
